Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis:

End-to-End Data Analytics Project (Python, SQL, Power BI)


This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle, from raw data exploration to actionable business insights.
It highlights practical experience in Python data analysis, SQL querying across relational databases and interactive dashboard development using Power BI, along with professional reporting and presentation.

The project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to identify trends, patterns and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Dataset:

Customer shopping and transactional dataset.

Loaded and processed using Python.

Includes demographic, purchase and behavioral attributes.

Cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.

Key data preparation tasks:

Handling missing and duplicate values.

Data type standardization.

Feature validation for analysis and reporting.

Tools & Technologies:

Data Analysis & Programming:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Databases & Querying:

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

SQL (joins, aggregations, filtering, subqueries)

Business Intelligence & Reporting:

Power BI (DAX, interactive dashboards, KPIs)

Analytical report (documentation)

Gamma (presentation / PPT creation)

Project Workflow:

1. Data Loading:

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial data profiling and validation.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed distributions, trends and relationships.

Identified outliers and data quality issues.

Created visualizations to support insight discovery.

3. Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

Standardized column formats and data types.

Prepared clean datasets for database ingestion.

4. SQL Analysis:

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL Server.

Executed SQL queries to answer key business questions.

Performed aggregations, joins and segmentation analysis.

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI):

Connected Power BI to the database.

Built interactive dashboards with KPIs and filters.

Designed visuals for business stakeholders.

6. Reporting & Presentation:

Created a structured analytical report summarizing findings.

Developed a professional presentation using Gamma.

Focused on clear storytelling and business impact.

Dashboard:

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Customer and sales KPIs.

Purchasing and behavioral trends.

Category and spending analysis.

Interactive filters for deeper exploration.

The dashboard is designed to support executive-level and operational decision-making.

Results & Insights:

Identified key customer purchasing patterns.

Highlighted trends in spending behavior and product categories.

Provided data-backed insights to support business strategy.

Demonstrated the ability to translate data into actionable recommendations.
